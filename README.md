Include a brief description of your test plan as a text document

### Description
For the revision of the previous class activity, we refactored our game board into 3 different classes: Player, Game, Board. We completed our unit test cases for each class and applicable functions. In addition, we created several Integration Tests in which we test the overall relations of class dependencies. This was done by creating several scenarios in which player x and player o won, as well as an occurrence of a draw.
